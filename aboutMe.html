	<h3>Who Am I</h3>

		<p>My name is Benjamin Ray, and I'm an undergraduate computer science major currently attending Collin County Community College with plans to transfer to UTD in the following years. I would love to work in the fields of artificial intelligence or machine learning. Mathematics and web design are something I enjoy doing, and I'm usually working on various side projects related to web development or programming.</p>

	<h3>My Background</h3>

		<p>During my senior year of high school I started an apprenticeship as an aircraft mechanic at Addison Airport. I spent five years working on various aircraft while earning my aircraft mechanic certifications before deciding to return to college. During my time as a mechanic I was able to travel all across the U.S. and meet many interesting people. I like to use the experiences and skills I gained as a mechanic to take a different approach to tutoring and learning.</p>

	<h3>My Qualifications</h3>

		<p>While working as an aircraft mechanic I spent a considerable amount of time training an apprentice mechanic in various maintenance duties related to that field such as electrical theory, troubleshooting circuits and electrical systems, hydraulic systems, and advanced reciprocating power plants. After starting college, I began helping others with their class materials and homework when they had trouble, and eventually was tutoring various students in basic web design, basic Javascript, and mathematics.</p>

	<h3>What Sets Me Apart From Other Tutors</h3>

		<p>By using my unique background to connect with students of all ages and skill levels, I can deliver specific tutoring to match the needs of the student. Since I am also a student currently, I am familiar with current editions of textbooks and class requirements at college as well as the various online homework platforms that can give students trouble. Ultimately, my approach and methods to tutoring are tailored specifically to each respective student and their needs.</p>
