	<h3>Are you struggling with math?</h3>

		<p>You are not alone. Studies show that over 50% of people taking college level algebra receive a grade lower than C (Ganter & Haver, 2011), which can prevent completion of undergraduate programs in many STEM and business fields. Most students who struggle with these courses fail because their understanding of foundational mathematics skills is insufficient.</p>

	<h3>Take control</h3>

		<p>Studies also show that students who use sources outside the classroom, such as tutoring and math labs, earn higher grades and maintain better academic standing than those who do not (Cooper, 2007). Tutoring gives you the opportunity to improve your understanding of mathematics, therefore setting yourself apart from fellow classmates.</p>

	<h3>Is tutoring right for you</h3>

		<p>From returning students who haven't opened a textbook in years, to ex-military students, or recent high school graduates who need a solid foundation, all types of students will benefit from tutoring as it is the best way to develop a deeper understanding of foundational mathematics skills.</p>

	<h3>How we can help</h3>

		<p>By using custom made lessons that are designed and built specifically to target your weak subject areas, and at a fraction of the cost compared to other local tutoring services, students will develop a solid foundation of skills and gain the necessary tools that are needed in order to excel in college level mathematics courses and beyond...</p>
